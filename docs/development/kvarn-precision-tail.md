# KVarN precision-tail architecture and validation record

This record defines how BeeLlama combines KVarN records with the shared exact
precision-tail contract. The user-facing behavior is documented in
`docs/beellama-features.md`; this page records the invariants, backend behavior,
state boundary, and reproducible validation evidence.

## Logical policy

KVarN uses a 128-token group and retains three attention regions: the permanent
non-SWA 128-token sink, compressed body records, and an exact recent suffix.
For each canonical cache group:

```text
intrinsic = min(128, effective_window)
explicit  = min(align_up(raw_request, 128), effective_window)
effective = max(intrinsic, explicit)
```

An omitted request and numeric zero therefore preserve the paper-faithful
128-token suffix. Positive numeric, positional, named, structural-ID, and
`auto` requests enlarge it. The physical ubatch does not participate in this
formula. When an SWA group has `effective == effective_window`, it becomes a
compact native-exact F16/BF16 ring with `W + R` rows and allocates neither
KVarN records nor stage tensors.

## Storage and attention

KVarN staging is incomplete-group workspace, not precision policy. A completed
128-token K/V group is quantized eagerly on CPU, CUDA, and the Vulkan store
implementation, including when its rows remain in the exact suffix. This makes
record validity independent of future ubatch segmentation or exact-row
eviction.

The compact overlay stores `N + R` rows of canonical post-RoPE K and canonical
V in the selected F16 or BF16 type. The active ubatch is a separate graph-local
canonical segment and is committed only after attention. KVarN records retain
their rotated K domain and original V domain.
KVarN defaults to the paper-faithful F16 representation; an explicit BF16
request remains supported and takes precedence over that default.
Each query receives exact source indices for its own logical suffix. The body
route excludes sink/tail overlap and exports its final FP32 row maximum and
softmax denominator. CUDA merges the exact suffix against that metadata, so
sink, body, and suffix form one softmax and each physical key contributes once.
The same generic tail descriptor and lifecycle logic remains KVarN-neutral.

Head dimensions 128, 256, and 512 are handled as one, two, or four KVarN slices.
The WHT/store paths accept F16 and BF16 canonical inputs. CUDA uses optimized
native kernels; ROCm/HIP selects physical-wave split decode or generic
WMMA/MFMA on matrix-capable devices and retains the portable direct-record
kernel elsewhere. CPU and Vulkan also consume KVarN views directly. All four
paths fuse the F16/BF16 exact tail
into the same softmax. Vulkan native attention requires shader Int64 and
buffer-device-address support and otherwise declines the native route.

The direct and compact segmented-tail entry paths share one route selector.
Compact tails invoke the KVarN body with an explicit compact-tail entry tag
before the exact contribution is merged. Forced-portable tests without current
segments may enter KVarN directly. Versioned route counters distinguish both
entries without changing the persistent tail or record ABI.

Persistent placement is finalized in two phases. KVarN records and F16 stages
are allocated first; their realized buffer owner is then used for route
selection and for the exact K/V tensors. A tensor/meta-split record body rejects
the overlay before exact tensors, the shared tail arena, or generation metadata
are allocated. Layer split remains supported because each record, stage, exact
tensor, graph consumer, and state row stays with the owning layer device.

## Lifecycle and state

Exact rows follow the shared `(stream, cell, generation)` identity model.
Sequence copy, remove, keep, add/divide, position shift, cache clear, cell reuse,
SWA wrap, and graph reuse update compressed and exact representations together.
Coverage reports the intrinsic/explicit request and any body-only degradation.

Prompt reuse is continuous across requests and message boundaries. Divergence
inside the live exact suffix trims exactly. For older compressed history, the
removal planner rounds the requested suffix start down to the overlapping
`KVAR_N_GROUP` boundary and retains every earlier complete group only when the
physical stream is sequence-owned. Non-unified streams are sequence-owned; a
unified stream qualifies only while every other mapped sequence has no live
cells. Contention rejects partial rollback, fully reevaluates the requesting
slot, and preserves the other slot.

Every composite child must accept the same planned boundary. Hybrid Qwen3.6
models whose recurrent child retains no rollback states (`n_rs_seq == 0`)
therefore reevaluate a deep historical divergence even though the KVarN
attention child alone could align it. This is a safe composite miss, not a
KVarN record-layout failure. Exact-tail divergence and cumulative appends remain
reusable. Non-recurrent or sufficiently checkpointed composites receive the
group-aligned benefit and reevaluate at most 127 extra positions.

KVarN state version 13 serializes logical records, compact exact payloads, membership,
and structural/type/preset identity. It does not serialize transient workspace
as precision state, so `ub=128 -> ub=512` and the reverse restore without
changing logits. Tail length, rollback horizon, exact type, KVarN preset,
representation, and component mismatch fail closed. Version 12 remains readable
when its logical representation is compatible. Version 11 is rejected because
its physical stage/tail layout cannot be reinterpreted safely.

Unified per-sequence save and restore both require an exclusive structured
stream. A contended idle slot is not offloaded to RAM, and a contended restore
is treated as a cache miss; neither operation may serialize or overwrite the
other sequence's records. The shared precision-tail manifest is version 3 and
supports host or on-device tensor transfer. It restores metadata-only identities
as well as tensor payloads; version 2 remains valid for legacy non-compact
layouts, and version 1 input retains conservative degraded provenance.

Hybrid iSWA has an additional placement rule. With multiple non-unified slots,
eligible non-SWA layers use KVarN while SWA layers use a warned standard-cache
fallback. If the selected preset requires fail-closed behavior, context
creation fails instead. Unified or single-slot configurations can use KVarN for
both layer groups when their native route is otherwise eligible.

Matched bounded Qwen runs at `ub=128/256/512` remained near Mean KLD
0.0019-0.0029 for requests 0, 128, and 512 after the body-metadata fix. Matched
Gemma runs at the same ubatches showed no segmentation discontinuity within
reported uncertainty. Full-window BF16 Gemma promotion was exact at every
ubatch (`abs(Mean KLD) <= 0.000001`, 100% same-top), and the model-backed state
test matched a direct BF16 cache with logits NMSE below `1e-10`.
